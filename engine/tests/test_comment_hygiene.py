"""A comment in the engine states a constraint; git carries the provenance.

The twin of portal/tests/test_comment_hygiene.py, over the engine's own tree. Two kinds of surface
live here and both are held to the same rule. The SERVED tier is the CSS _pages.py inlines into
every page it emits, so those comment bytes are multiplied by the corpus and are capped as well as
swept. The SOURCE tier is engine/extract, engine/scripts, the rest of the package and this suite:
a comment may state what must hold and why it would break otherwise, an invariant another file
depends on, a bare pointer to the pin that holds it, or a licence obligation, and may not carry
design history, decision provenance, work-item identifiers, dates, placeholders, commented-out
code or the name of a contract document. Test files keep their pin semantics and may cite a
contract path, because that is how a pin is traced.

IMAGE TOPOLOGY. Every path this module reads is under engine/, which deploy/docker/engine.Dockerfile
COPYs to /app/engine, so this test runs identically on a checkout and inside the engine image and
needs no skip. It must stay that way: reaching for portal/, docs/ or .github/ from here would make
the module skip or fail in the image lanes, where those trees are not shipped. That is also why the
extractor below is pasted rather than imported: a shared module outside engine/ would not ship.
deploy/tests holds the three copies of the shared block equal instead.

THIS FILE IS EXCLUDED FROM ITS OWN SWEEP, by basename, because the vocabulary it forbids has to be
written down somewhere to be forbidden.

Fails if: any comment on a covered surface breaks the rule, OR the served CSS carries more comment
bytes than its cap, OR the extractor stops seeing comments on a surface class at all (a scanner
that reads nothing must not report PASS over it).

# THE EXTRACTOR. One left-to-right scan per file, so every comment is counted
# once and only once: a // inside a /* */ block, a /* inside a line comment, a #
# inside a quoted shell word and a // inside a URL are none of them comments,
# and a scan that reads them as comments overstates the bytes a cap measures.
#
# The scanners are string-aware, which is what lets a comment AFTER code on the
# same line be counted: a regex anchored to the start of a line cannot tell a
# trailing comment from a slash inside a string. JavaScript is the hard case,
# because / is both division and the opening of a regex literal and a regex may
# contain \/\/. The tell is the token before the slash: a value (an identifier
# or number that is not a keyword, a ) or a ]) means division, anything else
# means a regex. That is the standard heuristic; it misreads only code that
# divides by a parenthesised expression and writes a comment marker inside the
# divisor.
