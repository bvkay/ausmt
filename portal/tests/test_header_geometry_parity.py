"""Fixed nav geometry: the header's tab group sits at ONE x position on every page and view.

Both headers - the SPA's (portal/index.html) and the static pages' (engine/extract/_pages.py,
_CSS) - divide into three zones: .hleft (identity), .hcenter (the tab group and its two supporting
controls), .hright (the contextual status slot). With auto-basis sides (flex:1 1 auto) each side
zone grew with its OWN content, so the "centred" tab group was shoved to a different x position
wherever the identity block or the status slot changed width: the map view's live counter, the
surveys view's workspace line, the /surveys hub's static counts and a survey page's empty slot
each parked the tabs somewhere else. Equal ZERO-basis sides (flex:1 1 0 plus min-width:0 on BOTH
sides) hand the leftover space out evenly whatever the sides hold, so the centre group is
geometrically centred on every surface and the tabs stop moving between pages.

TWO HALVES, ONE GEOMETRY. test_both_headers_pin_the_zero_basis_geometry asserts the rule itself on
each surface (the geometry, as rendered CSS). test_the_two_headers_carry_identical_zone_rules
asserts the SPA's zone rules and the static pages' are character-identical, so an edit to one
surface cannot silently re-float the other while both stay locally plausible.

WHY THE ENGINE HALF LIVES HERE rather than in engine/tests: portal-ci runs on portal/** AND on
engine/extract/_pages.py (see .github/workflows/portal-ci.yml), so a change to either header fires
this lane; the engine lane triggers on engine/** alone and cannot see an index.html edit. The
engine half is read from _pages.py's SOURCE TEXT, the same mechanism as
test_collection_colours.py: _pages.py cannot simply be imported (it sibling-imports _au_outline
and _stationcheck, which need the engine's own path set up), and re-typing its CSS here would only
pin a third copy of it.

The narrow-width wrap is part of the bargain: at 760px and under, both headers stack their zones
full-width, which is what keeps three 112px tabs from dragging a 375px page sideways. Zero-basis
sides must not cost that, so the stacking override is pinned on both surfaces too, AFTER the zone
rules - the two selectors tie on specificity, and source order is what makes the wrap win.
